\title{Area-weighted classification accuracy assessment}
\usage{
sits_accuracy(label_cube, validation_csv)
}
\arguments{
\item{label_cube}{A tibble with metadata about the classified maps.}

\item{validation_csv}{A CSV file path with validation data}
}
\value{
A list of lists: The error_matrix, the class_areas, the unbiased
estimated areas, the standard error areas, confidence interval 95% areas,
and the accuracy (user, producer, and overall), or NULL if the data is empty.
}
\description{
To use this function the input table should be
a set of results containing
both the label assigned by the user and the classification result.
Accuracy assessment set us a confusion matrix to determine the accuracy
of your classified result.
This function uses an area-weighted technique proposed by Olofsson et al. to
produce more reliable accuracy estimates at 95% confidence level.

This function performs an accuracy assessment of the classified, including
Overall Accuracy, User's Accuracy, Producer's Accuracy
and error matrix (confusion matrix) according to [1-3].

# get the samples for Mato Grosso for bands NDVI and EVI

# build an extreme gradient boosting model
